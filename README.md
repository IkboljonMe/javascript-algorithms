# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

This repo contains my implementation of various data structures and algorithms in JavaScript. The goal of this project is to help others learn and practice their understanding of fundamental algorithms and data structures.

## [Data Structures](https://github.com/IkboljonMe/javascript-algorithms/tree/main/src/data-structures)

The following data structures are implemented in this project:

- [Linked List](https://github.com/IkboljonMe/javascript-algorithms/tree/main/src/data-structures/linked-list)
- [Stack](https://github.com/IkboljonMe/javascript-algorithms/tree/main/src/data-structures/stack)
- [Queue]()
- [Binary Tree]()
- [Heap]()
- [Hash Table](https://github.com/IkboljonMe/javascript-algorithms/tree/main/src/data-structures/hash-table)
- [Trie]()
- [Graph]()

Each data structure is implemented as a JavaScript class, and includes Jest test cases to ensure correctness.

## [Algorithms](https://github.com/IkboljonMe/javascript-algorithms/tree/main/src/algorithms)

The following algorithms are implemented in this project:

- [Tortoise Hara](https://github.com/IkboljonMe/javascript-algorithms/tree/main/src/algorithms/linked-list/TortoiseHare)

Each algorithm is implemented as a function, and includes Jest test cases to ensure correctness.

## Usage

To use this project, simply clone the repo and run **npm install** to install the required packages. You can then run **npm test** to execute all the Jest test cases.
To install all packages:

```
npm install
```

To test:

```
npm test
```

If you want to run tests for a specific data structure or algorithm, you can specify the file path of the test using the **--PATH** option. For example, to run tests for the linked list data structure, run **npm test -- data-structures/linked-list.test.js**.

```
npm test -- data-structures/linked-list.test.js
```
